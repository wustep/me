# GUI — Untitled design language

> **wustep.me:** the theme is defined in [`styles/tokens.css`](styles/tokens.css) using this vocabulary. The default preset is **Paper**; Untitled (the downloaded snapshot) and Ink are alternatives. Fonts are fixed to **Crimson Pro + Inter**, mapped onto the kit's `brand`/`editorial` and `ui` roles. Read [gui/wustep.md](gui/wustep.md) for local decisions, which take precedence over the snapshot.

Use this guide and the accompanying skills to build with the supplied theme. The download contains Markdown guidance and theme references. Implement the theme in the receiving app’s existing styling system and components.

## Add to a project

Keep `GUI.md` and `gui/` at the project root. The install command places the three skills in the project’s `.agents/skills/` directory. When using the ZIP instead, copy the three folders in `skills/` there, preserving any existing skills and local edits. Add a short pointer to the project’s active agent instructions: “For UI work, follow GUI.md and use graphical-ui, graphical-convert, or graphical-audit as appropriate.” Preserve the instructions already there. Agents with other conventions can follow this guide directly.

For initial adoption, use `graphical-convert`. Read the [theme reference](gui/themes.md), define its light/dark values as named tokens in the app’s current theme system, and map the relevant component parts and states to existing shared components. Preserve framework, routing, behavior, dependencies, and intentional local customizations. Add only missing packages when the implementation requires them, using the project’s package manager and version policy.

Fonts are references only. Users must license, download, and configure their own font files. Preserve the named families, weights, and fallback stacks; report unavailable fonts rather than downloading or substituting them silently.

## Find the actual theme values

The [theme index](gui/themes.md) links to the included project’s literal font families and weights, text sizes, line heights, letter spacing, spacing, radii, borders, shadows, motion, and resolved CSS variables for both modes. Each theme links to its effective component token assignments, including defaults, shared parts, variants, and states.

These references capture the project at download time. After deliberate local customization, the app’s active token definitions and components take precedence. Read only the theme and component sections needed by the task.

## Rules for UI work

- Locate the active theme, color mode, shared components, and nearby patterns before choosing styles. Preserve existing behavior and intentional customizations.
- Use the existing theme vocabulary. Do not introduce colors, text steps, spacing steps, radii, shadows, or motion values to finish a screen. Identify a gap when no suitable choice exists; change the theme when requested.
- Keep named references at use sites. Typography includes font role, weight, size, line height, and letter spacing. Literal values belong in token definitions.
- Reuse shared components and visual roles. Compose new patterns while keeping equivalent controls consistent. Give information a clear home and avoid redundant content.
- Grid tracks, breakpoints, content widths, aspect ratios, and positioning can be structural choices. Preserve verified aliases, meaningful data encodings, and external widgets in context.
- Preserve keyboard focus, accessible labels, form values, interaction states, and theme propagation into portals. Render edges with composed box shadows and zero native border width, retaining opacity and theme stroke placement.
- Preserve dependency versions, ranges, overrides, and lockfiles. Check APIs against installed versions and follow the project’s verification and browser-review policy.

## Read what the task needs

For interface creation or revision, read Interface judgment and Foundations, then the relevant component guide. A small edit does not trigger an application-wide audit.
